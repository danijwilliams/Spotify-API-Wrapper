# Spotify Web API PHP
A early, work in progress PHP implementation of Spotify's Web API.

Look at `demo.php` for a simple example. All endpoints can be requested. However, response parsing and error handling must be handled by you for now.

## Installation
1. Create a new app at https://developer.spotify.com/
2. Enter your app credentials
3. Call the API!
